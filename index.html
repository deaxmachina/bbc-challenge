      On November 7, Indian capital, Delhi woke up to a blanket of thick grey smog.  
      The toxic haze was so severe that politicians announced plans to close schools.  
      United Airlines shut all of its flights from the US to Delhi. 
      Visibility was poor as pollution levels reached 30 times the World Health Organization's 
      recommended limit in some areas."
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the data from the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research website, 
      the levels of tiny particulate matter (known as PM 2.5) that enter deep into the lungs reached 
      as high as 700 micrograms per cubic metre in some areas of Delhi on November 6th. 
      The air quality standard for PM 2.5 is 15 Âµg/m3 and anything above 81 Âµg/m3 falls 
      under poor air quality standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some reports claimed that New Delhi's air quality was so severe it was equivalent to smoking 
      45 cigarettes a day. We looked at the data to see if this was true.
